# On the Edit file tab, add a '#', followed by a space, before any content you like to make it an H1 Header. You can add more headers, using one to six '#' characters followed by a space

Here I used one # in the above line of this markdown file. Becasue as `<#>` This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest.

# Let's add an image. Including descriptive text in the square brackets. This text can be read aloud for people using screen readers. It's also shown at times when image doesn't display, such as when there's a poor connection.
