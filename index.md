# On the Edit file tab, add a '#', followed by a space, before any content you like to make it an H1 Header. You can add more headers, using one to six '#' characters followed by a space

Here I used one # in the above line of this markdown file. Becasue as `<#>` This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest.
